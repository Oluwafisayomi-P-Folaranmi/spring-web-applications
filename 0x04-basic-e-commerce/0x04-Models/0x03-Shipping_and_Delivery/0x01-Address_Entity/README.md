## **Address Entity**: `01:25:00`

The `Address` model represents **location-based information** related to users, customers, sellers, or businesses. It is commonly **used to store delivery and billing addresses**.

### **Key Aspects of the `Address` Table**

  1. **Normalization & Reusability**  
     - Instead of storing addresses details directly in the `User` table, a **separate `Address` table** ensures better database design by avoiding redundancy.
     - Users can have **multiple addresses** (e.g., home, office).
     - Addresses can be **linked to multiple entities** (e.g., customers, sellers, warehouses).

  2. **Relationships**  
     - Typically, the `Address` table has a **one-to-many (1:N) relationship** with the `User` table, where one user can have multiple addresses.
     - It may also relate to orders for **shipping & billing addresses**.
