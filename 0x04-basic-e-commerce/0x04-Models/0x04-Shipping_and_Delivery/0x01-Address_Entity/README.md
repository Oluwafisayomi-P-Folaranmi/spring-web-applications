## **Address Entity**

The `Address` table in a database model represents **location-based information** related to users, customers, sellers, or businesses. It is commonly used in **e-commerce, logistics, and user management systems** to store delivery and billing addresses.

---

### **Key Aspects of the `Address` Table**
1. **Normalization & Reusability**  
   - Instead of storing address details directly in the `User` table, a **separate `Address` table** ensures better database design by avoiding redundancy.
   - Users can have **multiple addresses** (e.g., home, office).
   - Addresses can be **linked to multiple entities** (e.g., customers, sellers, warehouses).

2. **Relationships**  
   - Typically, the `Address` table has a **one-to-many (1:M) relationship** with the `User` table, where one user can have multiple addresses.
   - It may also relate to orders for **shipping & billing addresses**.
