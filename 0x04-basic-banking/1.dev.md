That sounds like a solid project! A basic banking monolith application using Spring Boot would typically involve key features like:  

### **Core Features**  
1. **User Management** – Customers and admin roles, authentication, and authorization.  
2. **Accounts** – Savings, current, and loan accounts with balance tracking.  
3. **Transactions** – Deposits, withdrawals, and transfers between accounts.  
4. **Loan Management** – Loan applications, approvals, and repayments.  
5. **Statements & Reports** – Account statements and transaction history.  

### **Technology Stack**  
- **Spring Boot** – Core framework for building the monolith.  
- **Spring Security** – For authentication and authorization.  
- **Spring Data JPA** – ORM for database interactions.  
- **Spring Web (REST API)** – Exposing endpoints for UI or third-party services.  
- **Spring Boot Actuator** – Health monitoring and metrics.  
- **H2/PostgreSQL/MySQL** – Database for persistence.  

### **Basic Architecture**  
1. **Controller Layer** (REST APIs for customers and admins)  
2. **Service Layer** (Business logic for accounts and transactions)  
3. **Repository Layer** (Database access using JPA)  
4. **Entity Layer** (JPA entities representing customers, accounts, transactions, etc.)
