### **1. User Management (Authentication & Authorization)**
- **Features**:  
  - User registration & login.  
  - Role-based access (e.g., Customer, Admin, Teller).  
  - JWT-based authentication for security.  
- **Implementation**:  
  - Use **Spring Security** with JWT for authentication.  
  - Define roles using `@PreAuthorize` or method-level security.  
  - Store user credentials securely using **BCrypt hashing**.  

**Example User Entity (JPA)**  
```java
@Entity
public class User {
    @Id @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;
    private String username;
    private String email;
    private String password;
    
    @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)
    private Role role; // CUSTOMER, ADMIN, TELLER

    // Getters and setters
}
```

### **2. Accounts Management**
- **Features**:  
  - Open accounts (Savings, Current, Loan).  
  - Fetch account details.  
  - Check account balance.  
- **Implementation**:  
  - Define **Account entity** with `accountNumber`, `balance`, and `type`.  
  - Ensure balance updates are atomic using transactions.  
  - Use DTOs to separate API models from entities.  

**Example Account Entity (JPA)**  
```java
@Entity
public class Account {
    @Id @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;
    private String accountNumber;
    
    @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)
    private AccountType type; // SAVINGS, CURRENT, LOAN

    private BigDecimal balance;
    
    @ManyToOne
    private User owner; // Relationship with User

    // Getters and setters
}
```

---

### **3. Transactions (Deposits, Withdrawals, Transfers)**
- **Features**:  
  - Deposit money into an account.  
  - Withdraw money (with minimum balance checks).  
  - Transfer money between accounts.  
  - Transaction history.  
- **Implementation**:  
  - Use **Spring Transactions (`@Transactional`)** to ensure consistency.  
  - Log all transactions in a separate table.  
  - Enforce business rules (e.g., **minimum balance requirement for savings accounts**).  

**Example Transaction Entity (JPA)**  
```java
@Entity
public class Transaction {
    @Id @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;
    
    @ManyToOne
    private Account account;  // Account involved in transaction
    
    private BigDecimal amount;
    
    @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)
    private TransactionType type; // DEPOSIT, WITHDRAWAL, TRANSFER

    private LocalDateTime timestamp = LocalDateTime.now();
    
    // Getters and setters
}
```

---

### **4. Loan Management**
- **Features**:  
  - Customers can apply for a loan.  
  - Admin approves/rejects loans.  
  - Automated loan repayment tracking.  
- **Implementation**:  
  - Create **Loan entity** with status (`PENDING`, `APPROVED`, `REJECTED`).  
  - Define scheduled tasks for **monthly repayments**.  
  - Implement business rules (e.g., **credit score validation, interest calculation**).  

**Example Loan Entity (JPA)**  
```java
@Entity
public class Loan {
    @Id @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;
    
    @ManyToOne
    private User borrower;

    private BigDecimal loanAmount;
    private BigDecimal remainingBalance;
    private LocalDate startDate;
    private LocalDate dueDate;
    
    @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)
    private LoanStatus status; // PENDING, APPROVED, REJECTED

    // Getters and setters
}
```

---

### **5. Statements & Reports**
- **Features**:  
  - Generate account statements (last transactions).  
  - Filter transactions by date.  
  - Export statements as **PDF/CSV**.  
- **Implementation**:  
  - Use `Spring Data JPA` queries for filtering transactions.  
  - Integrate **Apache POI or JasperReports** for PDF exports.  

---

### **6. Security & Compliance**
- **Features**:  
  - **Prevent overdrafts** for accounts.  
  - **Limit daily withdrawals** for customers.  
  - **Audit logs** for admin actions.  
  - **Encrypt sensitive data** (e.g., passwords, transactions).  
- **Implementation**:  
  - Implement **Spring Security event listeners** for logging login attempts.  
  - Use **AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming)** for logging sensitive operations.  
  - Store transaction details securely.
