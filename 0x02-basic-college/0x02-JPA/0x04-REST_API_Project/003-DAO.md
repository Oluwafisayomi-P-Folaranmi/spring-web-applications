# Spring Boot REST DAO 


We're going to create a JPA DAO in Spring Boot. 

<img alt="image" src="img_001.png" width="100%" height="50%"/> 

Looking at our application architecture and we'll make use of the **JPA API**, the standard JPA API, and we'll focus on that in this lesson and the following laboratory. 

The development process here for our DAO: 

  1. The first thing we'll do is update our database configs in the `application.properties`
  2. Then we'll create the Employee entity, 
  3. Next, we'll create the DAO interface, and 
  4. we'll create the implementation. 

## Update Database Configuration 

Let's go ahead and get started with step one of updating our database configs. 

Remember, in Spring Boot, we have this special properties file `application.properties`, and that file resides in your `/src/main/resources` directory. This is where we will add the data source properties. 

```application.properties 
#
# JDBC properties
#
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/employee_directory
spring.datasource.username=springstudent
spring.datasource.password=springstudent

```

And then remember, Spring Boot will automatically create the beans for data source, `DataSource` and entity manager, `EntityManager`, and we can inject those into our application. 


## Create `Employee` Entity 

We will create a new package, `/entity` in our root package, which will hold our entity, `Employee`. 

So what we need to do here is just create an entity and map this entity to our given database table. 

```Java Employee.java
@Entity
@Table(name="employee")
public class Employee {

    // define fields
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    @Column(name="id")
    private int id;

    @Column(name="first_name")
    private String firstName;

    @Column(name="last_name")
    private String lastName;

    @Column(name="email")
    private String email;

    // constructors

    // getter/setter 

    // toString 
}
```

Looking at the parameter constructor, we did not put `id` as a parameter to it, this is because `id` for an entity is going to be automatically generated. 

## The DAO Interface 

So moving along with our development process. The first thing we should do is create a new package here, `/dao` for our data access object. Then we will create our DAO interface, `EmployeeDAO`. 

```Java EmployeeDAO.java
public interface DAO {

    void save(Employee employee);

    List<Employee> findAll();

    Employee findById(Long employeeId);

    Employee update(Employee employee);

    void delete(Long employeeId);
}
```

Our DAO will simply have just one method. Just to get things up and running, we'll add more functionality later. So we have simply added this method, `findAll()` that'll return a list of employees. 

## The DAO Implementation 

So with our next step, creating the DAO implementation. 

We will create a new class in the pakage `/dao`. Implementing the `EmployeeDAO` interface, we have: 

```Java EmployeeDAOImpl.java
public class EmployeeDAO implements DAO {

    EntityManager entityManager;

    /**
     *
     * @param entityManager
     */
    public EmployeeDAO(EntityManager entityManager) {
        this.entityManager = entityManager;
    }

    /**
     * Saves and employee
     * @param employee
     */
    @Override
    @Transactional
    public void save(Employee employee) {
        entityManager.persist(employee);
    }

    /**
     * find all employee
     * @return
     */
    @Override
    public List<Employee> findAll() {
        TypedQuery<Employee> typedQuery = entityManager.createQuery("FROM Employee ORDER BY lastName ASC", Employee.class);
        List<Employee> employees = typedQuery.getResultList();
        return employees;
    }

    /**
     * find employee by id
     * @param employeeId
     * @return
     */
    @Override
    public Employee findById(Long employeeId) {
        return entityManager.find(Employee.class, employeeId);
    }

    /**
     * update employee
     * @param employee
     * @return
     */
    @Override
    @Transactional
    public Employee update(Employee employee) {
        Employee updatedEmployee = entityManager.merge(employee);
        return null;
    }

    /**
     * delete employee
     * @param employeeId
     */
    @Override
    @Transactional
    public void delete(Long employeeId) {
        Employee employee = entityManager.find(Employee.class, employeeId);
        entityManager.remove(employee);
    }
}
```

We have annotated it with the `@Repository` annotation. We have used the constructor to inject an object of the `EntityManager` interface. Remember, the Entity Manager is automatically created by Spring Boot and we can simply inject it here into our application. 

We have made a query in the method, `findAll`. We execute the query and returned the result list. And this is basically it for using a standard JPA API. Very simple, very straightforward.
