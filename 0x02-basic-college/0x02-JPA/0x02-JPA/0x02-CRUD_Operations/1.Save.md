# Saving Objects 

## DAO Interface

```java
public interface DAO {

    public void save(Student student);
}
```

## DAO Implementation

```Java StudentDAOImpl.java
@Repository
public class StudentDAOImpl implements StudentDAO {

	private EntityManager entityManager;

	...

	@Override
	@Transactional
	public void save(Student theStudent) {
		entityManager.persist(theStudent);
	}
}
```

And then we have an implementation here for this `save()` method. So they'll pass in a student object, and then I can use this JPA entity manager to actually save the Java object using `entityManager.persist()`. And I pass in the student, and this will actually save the Java object to the database. 

So Spring framework provides a `@Transactional` annotation. So this transactional annotation will automatically begin and end a transaction for your JPA code behind the scenes. So for our `save()` method, we know we want this to run inside of a transaction, so we make use of this `@Transactional` annotation.

And then spring will provide translation of any JDBC related exceptions. So here, when I say translation, meaning that if you have any checked JDBC exceptions, Spring will translate these to unchecked exceptions. Basically makes the coding a bit easier here for interfacing with a given database. So here's like an updated version of our DAO implementation.

### Main Application 

We need to update our main application. So remember, back in our CRUD demo application, we had our little hello world example. 

```Java CruddemoApplication.java 
@SpringBootApplication
public class CruddemoApplication {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(CruddemoApplication.class, args);
	}

	@Bean
	public CommandLineRunner commandLineRunner(StudentDAO studentDAO) {
		return runner -> {
			createStudent(studentDAO);
		};
	}

	// Trying to run the architecture at onces 
	private void createStudent(StudentDAO studentDAO) {
		// create the student object
		System.out.println("Creating new student object...");
		Student tempStudent = new Student("Paul", "Doe", "paul@luv2code.com");
		// save the student object
		System.out.println("Saving the student...");
		studentDAO.save(tempStudent);
		// display id of the saved student
		System.out.println("Saved student. Generated id: " + tempStudent.getId());
	}
}
```

And so for the `commandLineRunner`, we will inject the `StudentDAO`. We then call this method `createStudent()`. 

And this `createStudent()`, we define right here. So they pass in the DAO. Basically in this `createStudent()` method, we create the student object by using the `new` keyword. We save the student by using our DAO, and then we display the ID of the saved student. 

And then we could also go into our database and do a query on the table and verify that the information is actually in the database. And we'll accomplish that in our coding lesson coming up. We'll use the MySQL Workbench to verify information in the database.

## Saving Multiple Objects 

Now what we want to do here is test out the **auto increment** feature by writing some more code to create multiple students and add those students, and then we should see the ID column auto-increment using MySQL. Let's go ahead and write some code to demonstrate this. I'll move to my main application. 

I'll create this new method, `createMultipleStudens()` and I pass in the student DAO. I'll make use the IDE to help me generate this method. So we will create three student objects, `tempStudent1`, `tempStudent2`, and `tempStudent3` of our choice. And we will go ahead and write the appropriate code to save the student objects.


```Java
@SpringBootApplication
public class CruddemoApplication {

	...

    @Bean
    public CommandLineRunner commandLineRunner(StudentDAO studentDAO) {
        return runner -> {
			// createStudent(studentDAO);
            createMultipleStudents(studentDAO);
        };
    }

	...

    private void createMultipleStudents(StudentDAO studentDAO) {
        // create multiple students
        System.out.println("Creating 3 student objects ...");
        Student tempStudent1 = new Student("John", "Doe", "john@luv2code.com");
        Student tempStudent2 = new Student("Mary", "Public", "mary@luv2code.com");
        Student tempStudent3 = new Student("Bonita", "Applebum", "bonita@luv2code.com");

        // save the student objects
        System.out.println("Saving the students ...");
        studentDAO.save(tempStudent1);
        studentDAO.save(tempStudent2);
        studentDAO.save(tempStudent3);
    }
}
```
