# Querying Objects 

Here we will learn how to query for multiple objects. JPA has the **JPA Query Language (JPQL)**, a query language for retrieving objects. It's similar in concept to SQL. You can also make use of constraints (selectors) like `WHERE`, `LIKE`, `ORDER BY`, `JOIN`, `IN`, so and on and so forth. 

**JPQL is based on the entity class name and entity fields as opposed to the direct table names and table columns**. Of course, we want to assume we don't have a touch on the database itself, we assume that we can have a buffer to communicate with the database instead, using Java. Here's an example of retrieving all the students using JPQL. 

```Java
TypedQuery<Student> theQuery = entityManager.createQuery("FROM Student", Student.class);

List<Student> students = theQuery.getResultList();
```

We made use of the `entityManager.createQuery()`. We wrote some queries similar in concept to SQL - **`FROM Student`**. Now this is the name of the actual JPA entity, `Student`. Afterwards, we give `Student.class`. This method call will make sure that this is a `TypedQuery` and we make the assignment on the left hand side as `theQuery`. And one thing here on the query is that all JPQL syntax is **based on the entity class name and entity fields**. **Once we have this query created**, then we can retrieve the data by saying `theQuery.getResultList()` and it'll give us a list of students. And then from there we can use it in our application accordingly. 

### **`WHERE`** 

Let's take a look at an example of retrieving students whose last name equals `Doe`. Here I make use of entity manager, I say: 

```Java
TypedQuery<Student> theQuery = entityManager.createQuery(
	"FROM Student WHERE lastName=‘Doe’", Student.class);

List<Student> students = theQuery.getResultList();
```

### **`OR`**

We can also retrieve students using `OR` predicates. In this example we say: 

```Java
TypedQuery<Student> theQuery = entityManager.createQuery(
 "FROM Student WHERE lastName=‘Doe’ OR firstName=‘Daffy’", Student.class);

List<Student> students = theQuery.getResultList();
```

### **`LIKE`** 

We could also retrieve students using the `LIKE` predicate. In this example, we want to get a list of all the students whose email ends in `luv2code.com`. 

```Java
TypedQuery<Student> theQuery = entityManager.createQuery(
 "FROM Student WHERE email LIKE ‘%luv2code.com’", Student.class);

List<Student> students = theQuery.getResultList();
``` 

### **No Hard-Coding**

In the previous examples, we hard-coded the data, like `lastName='Doe'` in: 

```Java
TypedQuery<Student> theQuery = entityManager.createQuery(
	"FROM Student WHERE lastName=‘Doe’", Student.class);

List<Student> students = theQuery.getResultList();
```

Well you may want to use this as a parameter. So maybe a user entered this into a web form and you wanna read that information and then search for that user's name accordingly. Well, with JPQL we can make use of named parameters. We have this method called `findBYLastName()`. This is a method that we're defining in our DAO. And then I have the last name being passed in. 

```Java
public List<Student> findByLastName(String theLastName) {
	TypedQuery<Student> theQuery = entityManager.createQuery(
		"FROM Student WHERE lastName=:theData", Student.class);
	theQuery.setParameter("theData", theLastName);
	return theQuery.getResultList();
}
```

I make use of this special syntax here, `=:`. This is a **JPQL named parameter** prefixed with an equal and colon. This is a placeholder that will be filled later on the next line of code. Then, we give `theQuery.setParameter()`.

## Development Process 

Let's kinda step back and take a look at our development process of how we can add this into our DAO application. 

  1. We'll add this new method to the DAO interface. 
  2. We'll add a new method to the DAO implementation. 
  3. And then finally, we'll update the main application. 

## DAO Interface 

We'll add a new method to the DAO interface. I'll move in here and I'll define this method, findAll, and it'll return a list of students. 

```Java 
import com.luv2code.cruddemo.entity.Student;
import java.util.List;
public interface StudentDAO {

	...

    List<Student> findAll();

    List<Student> findByFirstName(String firstName);

    List<Student> findByLastName(String lastName);
}
```

## The DAO Implementation 

And now, we will add the new methods to the DAO implementation. The game plan is to create the query, and return query results. 

```Java
public class StudentDAOImpl implements StudentDAO {

	private EntityManager entityManager;

	...
	
	@Override
	public List<Student> findAll() {
		TypedQuery<Student> theQuery = entityManager.createQuery("FROM Student ORDER BY lastName", Student.class);
		return theQuery.getResultList();
	}

    @Override
    public List<Student> findByFirstName(String firstName) {
        TypedQuery<Student> typedQuery = entityManager.createQuery(
                "FROM Student WHERE firstName=:firstName", Student.class);
		typedQuery.setParameter(firstName, firstName);
        List<Student> students = typedQuery.getResultList();
        return students;
    }

    @Override
    public List<Student> findByLastName(String lastName) {
        TypedQuery<Student> typedQuery = entityManager.createQuery(
                "FROM Student WHERE firstName=:lastName", Student.class);
		typedQuery.setParameter(lastName, lastName);
        List<Student> students = typedQuery.getResultList();
        return students;
    }
}
```

We have set the query of students using, `entityManager.createQuery("FROM Student", Student.class)`. Now that we have the query, then we can actually return the query results by using `theQuery.getResultList()`. 

And that's all the main coding here for this findAll method. 

## Main Application 

```Java
@SpringBootApplication
public class CruddemoApplication {

	...

	@Bean
	public CommandLineRunner commandLineRunner(StudentDAO studentDAO) {
		return runner -> {
			// createStudent(studentDAO);
      		// createMultipleStudents(studentDAO);
			// readStudent(studentDAO);
			queryForStudents(studentDAO);
		};
	}

	private void queryForStudents(StudentDAO studentDAO) {
		// get list of students
		List<Student> theStudents = studentDAO.findAll();
		// display list of students
		for (Student tempStudent : theStudents) {
			System.out.println(tempStudent);
		}
	}
}
```

We want to get a list of students, and then display that list of students. 

I import the `java.util.List`. And now just do a simple `for` loop here to display the list of students. 

Let's go ahead and run this application and test it out. And success, the application printed out for students that it retrieved from the database. This is really good, I like it. 

And let's swing over to MySQL workbench, and verify this. Move to our student table, do a quick query and excellent. So we have the four students from the database also. And this matches with what our application displayed.
