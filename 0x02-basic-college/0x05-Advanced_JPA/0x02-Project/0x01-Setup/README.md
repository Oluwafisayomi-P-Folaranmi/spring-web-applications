## **Setup**

The dependencies will be needed for the database connection. So we will use: **web**, **JPA** dependency, **lombok** to reduce boilerplate code, and the **sql driver** dependency, since we're builing a database app.

Use [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/) to create a new project, `cloudinary` with the following dependencies:

  + **Spring Web**
  + **Spring Data JPA**
  + **MySQL Driver**
  + **Lombok**
