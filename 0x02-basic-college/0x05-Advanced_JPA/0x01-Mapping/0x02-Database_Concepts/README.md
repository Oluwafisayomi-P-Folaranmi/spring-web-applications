## **Database Concepts**

To take advantage of the concept we have defined from above, we need to review some database concepts. We need to review primary and foreign keys, and then cascade. 

### **Primary Key**

The primary key identifies a unique row in a table. It is customary for most developers to add it to every table.

### **Foreign Key**

The foreign key link tables together. It is a field in one table that refers to the primary key in another table. **You have to *register* the field so as to behave like a foreign key**.
