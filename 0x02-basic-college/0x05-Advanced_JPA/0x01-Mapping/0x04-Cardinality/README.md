## **Cardinality**

### **Unidirectional**

Here is an example of making use of a unidirectional relationship. You have an instructor and then you have the instructor detail. You load the instructor, and then from there you can access the instructor detail, but not in the reversed direction. So, it is a **one-way relationship**.

### **Bi-Directional**

We also have the idea of bi-directional. Here, we have the instructor and the instructor detail. We can also go the other way. We can load the instructor detail and add/have a reference to the given instructor.
