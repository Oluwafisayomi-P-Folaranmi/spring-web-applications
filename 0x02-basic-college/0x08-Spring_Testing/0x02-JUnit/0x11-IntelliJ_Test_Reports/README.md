# IntelliJ Test Reports

Code coverage measures how many methods/lines are called by your tests.

Coverage is represented as a percentage: 50% coverage etc.

In general, the higher the coverage the better
  + However, 100% is not always attainable
  + On most teams, 70%-80% is acceptable
  + Code coverage is only a metric and can be easily tricked with bad tests
  + Use the metric as simply one data point in your software process

## IntelliJ Support for Code Coverage

IntelliJ has built-in support for code coverage

  + Can generate coverage reports in the IDE
  + Also can generate HTML output for viewing in web browser.

To use this support in IntelliJ, after a run, find the tab for **Run 'DemoUtilsTest' with Coverage**.
