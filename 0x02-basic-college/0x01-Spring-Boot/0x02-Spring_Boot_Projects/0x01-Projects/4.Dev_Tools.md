# Spring Boot Dev Tools

When running Spring Boot applications, any changes made to the source code require manually restarting the application. This can be time-consuming and inefficient, especially during active development.  

## The Solution: Spring Boot DevTools

Spring Boot provides **spring-boot-devtools**, a tool that automatically restarts the application whenever the code is updated. By simply adding a dependency to the Maven **POM** file, developers can enable this feature without writing additional code.  

## Setting Up Spring Boot DevTools

To use **Spring Boot DevTools**, you need to add the following dependency to your **pom.xml**:  

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-devtools</artifactId>
    <optional>true</optional>
</dependency>
```

Once added, the application will automatically restart whenever the source code is modified.  

## Additional Setup for IntelliJ Community Edition

While most IDEs support Spring Boot DevTools out of the box, **IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition** requires additional configuration.  

### **Step 1: Enable "Build Project Automatically"**

1. Open **Preferences**.  
2. Navigate to **Build, Execution, Deployment â†’ Compiler**.  
3. Check the box **Build Project Automatically**.  

### **Step 2: Enable "Auto-Make"**  
1. Open **Preferences** again.  
2. Go to **Advanced Settings**.  
3. Check the box **Allow Auto-Make to Start**.  

After completing these steps, IntelliJ Community Edition will work seamlessly with Spring Boot DevTools.  

## Recap: Development Workflow  
1. Configure IntelliJ settings as mentioned above.  
2. Add **spring-boot-devtools** to **pom.xml**.  
3. Write and modify your code, such as adding a new REST endpoint.  
4. Observe automatic application reloads without manual restarts.  

Now that we have everything set up, let's jump into the IDE and get started!
