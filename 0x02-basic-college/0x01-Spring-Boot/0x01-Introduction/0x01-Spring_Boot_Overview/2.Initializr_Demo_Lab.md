# Spring Boot Initializr Demo

## Spring Initializr

Earlier we discussed the **Spring Initializr**. It's a website where you can quickly create a starter Spring project. So, it's at `start.spring.io` on the web. We basically go here,

  + To select our dependencies.
  + It'll actually create a Maven or Gradle project for us and then we can actually import that project into our IDE, like: **Eclipse**, **IntelliJ**, **NetBeans**, and so on.

And so, that's the basic idea of the Spring Initializr. 

## Maven
 
Now let's have a quick word on Maven. When building your Java project you may need additional **JAR** files. For example, **Spring**, **Hibernate**, **Commons Logging**, **JSON**, and so forth. And one approach is to simply download the JAR files from each project website and then manually add those JAR files to your build class path. And that's fine and that'll work okay.

### Maven Solution

However, Maven provides a nice solution. We simply tell Maven the dependencies the project that you're working on will need, like: Spring, Hibernate, et cetera. Maven will go out and download the JAR files for those projects for you.

Maven will automatically make those JAR files available during compile and run. And you can kind of think of Maven as like your friendly helper or your personal shopper.

## Spring Boot Initializr Demo Laboratory

### First Step: Spring Initializr Website

All right, so we're here at the **Spring Initializr** website, `start.spring.io`. We can generate different types of projects. Here, 

  + For the **Project**, we'll select Maven, 
  + For the **Language**, we'll choose Java.
  + And then also, as far as the **Spring Boot Version**, we'll choose the most recent version that they have here. Avoid the snapshot versions because they are alpha/beta. 
  + We can move into our **Project Metadata** where we can set up our coordinates here.
    - Group ID (name of my company/organisation): `com.opf`.
    - Artifact ID (name of my application): say, `mycoolapp`.
  + And for **Dependencies** here, this is where we choose the **Spring Boot starters** that we want or the actual *dependencies* that we want for our applications. 

Maven dependencies are external libraries or modules that are required by a Maven-based project to compile, build, and run properly. This includes modules such as: `spring-core`, `spring-context`, `spring-beans`, `spring-web`, `spring-jdbc`, etc. Maven is a build automation tool used primarily for Java projects, and it provides a convenient way to manage project dependencies through the use of a project object model (POM) file. Choosing **web**, this will give us the full stack web development with **Tomcat** and **Spring MVC**. 


### Second Step: Download the Zip File

  + And then from there, just go down to the bottom and **download** the `mycoolapp.zip` zip file by clicking on **Generate project**. 


### Third Step: Unzip File

  + I can swing over to my file system and the next step is **unzipping** that file. Checking the content of the directory, we have this **Pom** file and some other files and source and so on. 


### Fourth Step: Import Mavin Project

Import this Maven project using any IDE. It's going to import the Maven Project and actually download all the appropriate Maven dependencies that's needed for this given item. 

Now I have this `mycoolapp` as my Maven project here and there are a number of files that are in this project.

  + So we have the `pom.xml`, that's the Maven file. 
  + We have some `mvnw` files.  
  + Then we also have this `src/main/java/com.opf.springboot.demo.mycoolapp/MycoolappApplication.java` file. 
  + There's a resources directory, and
  + There's also a test directory. 

We'll cover every file on this project. 


### Spring Boot application: `MycoolappApplication.java`

Now let's just take a look at this Spring Boot application. It's called `MycoolappApplication.java`.


```Java Mycoolapplication.java
package com.opf.springboot.demo.mycoolapp;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
public class MycoolappApplication {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    SpringApplication.run(MycoolappApplication.class, args);
  }

}

```

We make use of a little fancy spring annotation up here for Spring Boot application. I'll talk more about that later. But basically says, hey we have this Spring Boot application and then we use this piece here `SpringApplication.run(MycoolappApplication.class, args)` to actually bootstrap the Spring Boot application. So we say, `SpringApplication.run` and we give the actual class name that we're gonna run, here `MycoolappApplication.class`. We'll get into all the gory details on how this Spring Boot application annotation works and also, how the main method works. 


### Running the Spring Boot application 

Run it as a Java application, not server, because Spring Boot actually includes its own server. And then if we review the logs here we'll see some interesting pieces of information. So it will start  `MycoolappApplication`. So it says, ooh, Tomcat (server) is initialized on port 8080.

So if I swing over to my web browser here and I just open up a new tab and I simply go to `localhost:8080` and oh, error page. So we haven't added any controllers or view pages and so on, but at least at this point we know that a server is up and running.
