# Bean Lifecycle Methods

When the Spring containers started, beans are instantiated, dependencies are injected, internal Spring processing occurs, and then it can execute your own custom initialization method. And then at that point, your bean is ready to use. And then once the container is shut down or stopped, then they'll actually make a call to your custom **destroy method**. 


## Purpose of Bean Lifecycle Methods

So what's the purpose of these **bean lifecycle methods** or **hooks**? 

  + You can add custom code during **bean initialization** 
    + Calling custom business logic methods
    + Setting up handles to resources (db, sockets, file etc)

  + You can add custom code during **bean destruction**
    + Calling custom business logic method
    + Clean up handles to resources (db, sockets, files etc)


## Init: method configuration

Now, this is how we can set up the method configuration for an init method. We make use of this `@PostConstruct` annotation. And then we can provide a method here, in this example, `doMyStartupStuff`. This is where you can add your own custom initialization code once the bean has been constructed. 


```Java
@Component
public class CricketCoach implements Coach {

    public CricketCoach() {
        System.out.println("In constructor " + getClass().getSimpleName());
    }

    @PostConstruct
    public void doMyStartupStuff() {
        System.out.println("In doMyStartupStuff" + getClass().getSimpleName());
    }

```


## Destroy: method configuration

We make use of the `@PreDestroy` annotation, and we have a method, `doMyCleanupStuff`. And this allows you to add your own custom logic here for any cleanup work that you need to do.

```Java
@Component
public class CricketCoach implements Coach {

    public CricketCoach() {
        System.out.println("In constructor " + getClass().getSimpleName());
    }

    @PostConstruct
    public void doMyStartupStuff() {
        System.out.println("In doMyStartupStuff" + getClass().getSimpleName());
    }

    @PreDestroy
	public void doMyCleanupStuff() {
        System.out.println("In doMyCleanupStuff" + getClass().getSimpleName());
    }

```

Okay, so here's the basic development process:

  + Define your methods for init and destroy, and 

  + Add the annotations for `@PostConstruct` and `@PreDestroy`. 



# Laboratory: 


## Step 1: The Dependency

Owing that we have the depencies. We will use the `CricketCoach` here, **singleton-scoped bean**.


```Java CricketCoach.java
@Component
@Scope(ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_PROTOTYPE)
public class CricketCoach implements Coach {

    public CricketCoach() {
        System.out.println("In constructor " + getClass().getSimpleName());
    }

    @Override
    public String getDailyWorkout() {
        return "Run around for 20 hours before cricket.";
    }

```

So step one of defining the methods for init and destroy, and then adding the annotations here for `@PostConstruct` and `@PreDestroy`. 


### init and destroy methods

I'll just write some quick codes: 


```Java CricketCoach.java
@Component
@Scope(ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_PROTOTYPE)
public class CricketCoach implements Coach {

    public CricketCoach() {
        System.out.println("In constructor " + getClass().getSimpleName());
    }

    // init methods
    @PostConstruct
    public void doMyStartupStuff() {
        System.out.println("In doMyStartupStuff(): " + getClass().getSimpleName());
    }

    // destroy methods
    @PreDestroy
    public void doMyCleanupStuff() {
        System.out.println("In doMyCleanupStuff(): " + getClass().getSimpleName());
    }

    @Override
    public String getDailyWorkout() {
        return "Run around for 20 hours before cricket.";
    }
}    

```


## Step 2: The Controller


```java DemoController
package com.opfolaranmi.demo_web.controller;

import com.opfolaranmi.demo_web.sport.Coach;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Qualifier;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class DemoController {

    private Coach myCoach;

    private Coach anotherCoach;
    @Autowired
    public DemoController(@Qualifier("cricketCoach") Coach theCoach,
                          @Qualifier("cricketCoach") Coach theAnotherCoach) {

        myCoach = theCoach;
        anotherCoach = theAnotherCoach;
    }

    @GetMapping("/dailyworkout")
    public String getTheDailyWorkoutForCoach() {

        return myCoach.getDailyWorkout();
    }

    @GetMapping("/check")
    public String checkIfBeansAreEqual() {

        return "The beans are the same: " + (myCoach == anotherCoach);
    }
}

```

Let's just run our application. Our app is up and running. And one thing to notice here in the logs; we see the code or the execution of our init method here. So in doMyStartupStuff for CricketCoach. So notice the previous line, we're in the constructor for CricketCoach and then we have our custom init method that runs as a PostConstruct. So this is great. I like it. Now if I stop the application, then we should execute our PreDestroy method. So we're gonna just stop, scroll down a bit, and then we'll see that this print line here in doMyCleanupStuff. So this code is actually executing as desired. So this was great. I like it. Good job.
