# Bean Scopes

Scope refers to the lifecycle of a bean. Such as, how long does the bean live, how many instances are created, and how is the bean shared? 


## What is singleton

Now the default scope in spring is `singleton`. What is a singleton? Spring Container creates only one instance of the bean by default, and it's cached in memory and all dependency injections for that bean will reference the same bean. It's just a singleton, one single item that's created in memory and shared amongst different other items. Here's an example of this.


```java DemoController
  ...

  @Autowired
  public DemoController(
      @Qualifier("cricketCoach") Coach theCoach,
      @Qualifier("cricketCoach") Coach theAnotherCoach) {

      myCoach = theCoach;
      anotherCoach = theAnotherCoach;
  }

  ...

```

So I have this demo controller. I have two references here, myCoach, anotherCoach. I'll inject it using qualifier. `theCoach`, and `theAnotherCoach` both point to the same instance, because by default, spring beans are singleton beans. There's only one instance that's created.


## Explicitly Specify Bean Scope

Now, we could also explicitly specify the bean scope. So in our class cricket coach we could make use of `@Scope` annotation, and then we give it `ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_SINGLETON`.


```java CricketCoach

  ...

  @Component
  @Scope(ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_SINGLETON)
  public class CricketCoach implements Coach {
      // Class implementation
  }

  ...

```


## Additional Spring Bean Scopes

There's additional spring bean scopes. 

  + `prototype`: 
    + It'll create a new bean incense for each container request or for each **injection point**. 

  + `request`: 
    + Scoped to an HTTP web request only used for web apps. 

  + `session`: 
    + Scoped to an HTTP web session. Again, only used for web apps. 

  + `global`: 
    + Scoped to the global HTTP web session in the case of web apps. 


## Prototype Spring Bean Scope Example

Now let's take a look at a `prototype` scope example. Now with `prototype` scope, a new object instance is created for each injection. So we have to specify the scope on the actual class (the bean). So cricket coach:


```java CricketCoach

  ...

  @Component
  @Scope(ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_PROTOTYPE)
  public class CricketCoach implements Coach {
      // Class implementation
  }

  ...

```

Let's look at a prototype scope example, a new object instance for each injection. We have our demo controller, we have our two fields here and then we reference our `CricketCoach`.


```java

...

@RestController
public class DemoController {

    private Coach myCoach;
    private Coach anotherCoach;

    @Autowired
    public DemoController(@Qualifier("cricketCoach") Coach theCoach,
                          @Qualifier("cricketCoach") Coach theAnotherCoach) {
        myCoach = theCoach;
        anotherCoach = theAnotherCoach;
    }

}

```

Since this is a **prototype scope bean**, you'll get a new object instance for each injection. So they point to two different areas of memory or two different beans.

## Step 1: The Dependency

```java Coach
package com.opfolaranmi.demo_web.sport;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

public interface Coach {

    String getDailyWorkout();
}

```

```java TrackCoach
package com.opfolaranmi.demo_web.sport;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
@Scope(ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_PROTOTYPE)
public class TrackCoach implements Coach {

    public TrackCoach() {

        System.out.println("In constructor: " + getClass().getSimpleName());
    }

    @Override
    public String getDailyWorkout() {

        return "4.......... Practice fast bowling for 15 minutes";
    }
}

```


```java TennisCoach
package com.opfolaranmi.demo_web.sport;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class TennisCoach implements Coach {

    public TennisCoach() {

        System.out.println("In constructor: " + getClass().getSimpleName());
    }

    @Override
    public String getDailyWorkout() {

        return "3.......  Practice your backhand volley";
    }
}

```


```java BaseballCoach
package com.opfolaranmi.demo_web.sport;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class BaseballCoach implements Coach {

    public BaseballCoach() {

        System.out.println("In constructor: " + getClass().getSimpleName());
    }

    @Override
    public String getDailyWorkout() {

        return "1.......... Spend 30 minutes ----------------- in batting practice";
    }
}

```


```java CricketCoach
package com.opfolaranmi.demo_web.sport;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class CricketCoach implements Coach{

    public CricketCoach() {

        System.out.println("In constructor: " + getClass().getSimpleName());
    }

    @Override
    public String getDailyWorkout() {

        return "2........ Practice fast bowling for 15 minutes.";
    }
}

```


### application.properties

To compensate for global initialisation, we use the application.properties file. Without the `@Lazy` annotation on the classes, they will be constructor at runtime even if they are not needed. We can run the program from here before we provide configuration for global lazy initialisation.


```application.properties
spring.application.name=demo-web

...

## Global Lazy Initialisation
spring.main.lazy-initialization=true

```


## Step 2: The Controller

How could we check on the scope? Well, we could write some code here as for a `@GetMapping`. So I'll compare the beans.


```java DemoController
package com.opfolaranmi.demo_web.controller;

import com.opfolaranmi.demo_web.sport.Coach;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Qualifier;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class DemoController {

    private Coach myCoach;
    private Coach anotherCoach;

    @Autowired
    public DemoController(@Qualifier("cricketCoach") Coach theCoach,
                          @Qualifier("cricketCoach") Coach theAnotherCoach) {
        myCoach = theCoach;
        anotherCoach = theAnotherCoach;
    }

    @GetMapping("/dailyworkout")
    public String getTheDailyWorkoutForCoach() {

        return myCoach.getDailyWorkout();
    }

    @GetMapping("/check")
    public String checkIfBeansAreEqual() {

        return "The beans are the same: " + (myCoach == anotherCoach);
    }
}

```

So this will check to see if this is the same bean. This will return true or false depending on the bean scope. For singleton scope, they return true, because remember singleton is shared and it points to the same bean. If it's prototype scope, it'll return false because with prototype you get a new instance for each one of them and they won't point to the same item.
