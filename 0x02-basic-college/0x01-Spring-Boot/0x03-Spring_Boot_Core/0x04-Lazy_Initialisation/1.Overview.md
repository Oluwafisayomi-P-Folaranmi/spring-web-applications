# Overview

Now by default, when your application starts, all beans are initialized. So it'll scan for all the components and all those components will be initialized. So Spring will create a new instance of each, and make them available. 

Now we can get some insights into this by setting up some diagnostics, or adding some println statements to our constructors. So on our `CricketCoach`, we'll add a `println()` statement where we'll simply print out the name of the class that we're processing on. We'll do a similar thing here for `BaseballCoach`, `TrackCoach`, and also `TennisCoach`.


```Java CricketCoach.java

@Component
public class CricketCoach implements Coach {

	public CricketCoach() {
		System.out.println("In constructor: " + getClass().getSimpleName());
	}

    @Override
    public String getDailyWorkout() {
        return "Practice fast bowling for 15 minutes";
    }
}

```

And now, when we start our application, then in the actual logs we should see: 

```log
In constructor: BaseballCoach  
In constructor: TrackCoach
In constructor: TennisCoach
In constructor: CricketCoach
In constructor: DemoController

```

Again, by the default when your application starts, all beans are initialized and Spring will create an instance of each and make them available. 


## Lazy Initialisation

Now we could make use of **lazy initialization**, where instead of creating all the beans up front, we can specify `@Lazy` initialization. So, a bean will only be initialized in the following cases:

  + When it's needed for a dependency injection, or
  + It is explicitly requested.

We simply add the `@Lazy` annotation to a given class and those rules will come into play. 

And here's a coding example: So for our `TrackCoach`, we'll say that our track coach is *lazy*, so we'll make use of the `@Lazy` annotation. This given bean will only be initialized if it's needed for dependency injection. If it's not needed, they won't create it.

```Java TrackCoach.java

@Component
@Lazy
public class TrackCoach implements Coach {

	public TrackCoach() {
		System.out.println("In constructor: " + getClass().getSimpleName());
	}

    @Override
    public String getDailyWorkout() {
        return "Practice fast bowling for 15 minutes";
    }
}

```

In this coding example here, with our `DemoController` and our constructor injection, we're going to inject the `CricketCoach`. And when we run the application, we'll see the outputs for our `BaseballCoach`, `CricketCoach`, and `TennisCoach`. 

```log
In constructor: BaseballCoach
In constructor: TennisCoach
In constructor: CricketCoach
In constructor: DemoController

```

Since we're not injecting the TrackCoach in this given scenario, then TrackCoach is not initialized.


## Global Lazy Initialisation Configuration 

Now to configure the other beans for lazy initialization, well, we'd need to add the `@Lazy` annotation to each class. Not a big deal if we have a small number of classes, but it turns into some real tedious work for a large number of classes. We can set a global initialisation across board. So in our `application.properties` file, we can set this spring boot property, `spring.main.lazy-initialization=true`. All beans are lazy, no beans are created until they're explicitly needed, including our `DemoController`. 

Once we access our REST endpoint of `/dailywork` out, then Spring will determine the dependencies for the `DemoController` and for the dependency resolution, Spring will create an instance of the `CricketCoach` first, and then create an instance of the `DemoController` and inject the actual `CricketCoach` into the `DemoController`. 


## Add println() for More Diagnostics 

For more diagnostics, let's add a `println()` to our `DemoController` constructor. 

So here at `DemoController`: 

```Java DemoController.java
    @Autowired
    public DemoController(Coach theCoach) {
    	System.out.println("In constructor: " + getClass().getSimpleName());
        myCoach = theCoach;
    }

```

So again, for the dependency resolution, Spring will create an instance of the `CricketCoach` first, then create an instance of the `DemoController`, and inject that into the actual `DemoController`. 


## Advantages of Lazy Initialisation 

Looking at lazy initialization: 

  + It only creates the objects as needed 
  + It may help you with faster startup time, if you have a large number of components. 

The disadvantages: 

  + If you have some web related components like `RestController`, it will not be created until requested. 
  + May not discover any configuration issues until too late. 
  + And you also need to make sure you have enough memory for all beans once created. 

So with this lazy initialization feature, it's actually disabled by default. You should really profile your application before configuring lazy initialization, to see if the advantages will even help you. And also, avoid the common pitfall of premature optimization. Because you could try and optimize something that's really not even worth it. All right, so just be aware of that, if you're moving to thinking about lazy initialization. However, we won't cover it here, just so you understand the concept, and just so you understand the techniques. 



# Laboratory


## Step 1: Dependency

The interface for the coaches is created.


```java Coach
package com.opfolaranmi.demo_web.sport;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

public interface Coach {

    String getDailyWorkout();
}

```

We will add **some diagnostics** here or add some `println()` statements to the constructors just so we can see everyone being created when the application starts up.


```java TrackCoach
package com.opfolaranmi.demo_web.sport;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Lazy;

@Component
@Lazy
public class TrackCoach implements Coach {

    public TrackCoach() {

        System.out.println("In constructor: " + getClass().getSimpleName());
    }

    @Override
    public String getDailyWorkout() {

        return "4.......... Practice fast bowling for 15 minutes";
    }
}

```


```java TennisCoach
package com.opfolaranmi.demo_web.sport;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Lazy;

@Component
@Lazy
public class TennisCoach implements Coach {

    public TennisCoach() {

        System.out.println("In constructor: " + getClass().getSimpleName());
    }

    @Override
    public String getDailyWorkout() {

        return "3.......  Practice your backhand volley";
    }
}

```


```java BaseballCoach
package com.opfolaranmi.demo_web.sport;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Lazy;

@Component
@Lazy
public class BaseballCoach implements Coach {

    public BaseballCoach() {

        System.out.println("In constructor: " + getClass().getSimpleName());
    }

    @Override
    public String getDailyWorkout() {

        return "1.......... Spend 30 minutes ----------------- in batting practice";
    }
}

```


```java CricketCoach
package com.opfolaranmi.demo_web.sport;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Lazy;

@Component
@Lazy
public class CricketCoach implements Coach{

    public CricketCoach() {

        System.out.println("In constructor: " + getClass().getSimpleName());
    }

    @Override
    public String getDailyWorkout() {

        return "2........ Practice fast bowling for 15 minutes.";
    }
}

```


## Step 2: The Controller


```java DemoController
package com.opfolaranmi.demo_web.controller;

import com.opfolaranmi.demo_web.sport.Coach;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Qualifier;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class DemoController {

    public Coach coach;

    @Autowired
    public DemoController(@Qualifier("cricketCoach") Coach theCoach) {

        coach = theCoach;
    }

    @GetMapping("/dailyworkout")
    public String getTheDailyWorkoutForCoach() {

        return coach.getDailyWorkout();
    }
}

```

Without the `@Lazy` annotation on the classes, they will be constructor at runtime even if they are not needed. We can run the program from here before we provide configuration for global lazy initialisation.


### The application.properties File

```application.properties
spring.application.name=demo-web

...

## Global Lazy Initialisation
spring.main.lazy-initialization=true

```
