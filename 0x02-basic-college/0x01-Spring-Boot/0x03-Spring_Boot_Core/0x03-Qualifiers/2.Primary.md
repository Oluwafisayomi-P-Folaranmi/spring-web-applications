# `@Primary` Annotation


Now resolving the issue with multiple coach implementations, we saw the example in the previous set of lessons, of, by making use of the `@Qualifier` annotation. We were super specific, by mentioning a coach by name. However, there's an alternate solution available. Instead of specifying a coach by name, using a qualifier annotation, I could say, "You know what? I simply need a coach. I don't care which coach. And I could say, Hey, if there are multiple coaches out there, then you coaches figure it out. You all tell me who's the **primary** coach. I really don't care. I simply need a coach to help me out, here. That's it." 


## Step 1: The Dependency

So as before, we had our multiple coach implementations, of our track coach, baseball coach, tennis coach, and cricket coach. Below is the implementation of `CricketCoach`:


```Java CricketCoach.java
package com.opf.springboot.demo.common;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
@Primary
public class CricketCoach implements Coach {
    @Override
    public String getDailyWorkout() {
        return "Practice fast bowling for 15 minutes";
    }
}

```

And then the one thing to notice here is, that now we make use of this new annotation `@Primary`. So this annotation basically says, out of the multiple coach implementations, this is going to be the primary implementation that you should use. Now we can resolve this using the primary. 


## Step 2: The Controller

So here's our code for our demo controller. 


```Java DemoController.java
...

@RestController
public class DemoController {
    // the field for the dependency
    private Coach myCoach;

    // the constructor for the dependency
    @Autowired
    public DemoController(Coach theCoach) {
        myCoach = theCoach;
    }

    // the mapping for "/dailyworkout"
    @GetMapping("/dailyworkout")
    public String getDailyWorkout() {
        return myCoach.getDailyWorkout();
    }
}

```

And now one thing to notice here, with our demo controller, and our constructor injection, is that there's no need to use the qualifier annotation. Because now, if there's multiple coaches, we know the primary coach, based on that `@Primary` annotation.


### Only One `@Primary`

If you mark multiple classes with `@Primary`, we will have a little problem. And when you run your application, there will be error, because more than one primary bean will be found.


### Mixing `@Primary` and `@Qualifier`

Now, you may also wonder, well, what about mixing primary and qualifier at the same time? Can I use both of those in the same class? The answer is yes, but you're asking for trouble. 

Not really, but you have to be aware of this is, that `@Qualifier` has the higher priority. So even if you mention a given class as the `@Primary` class, that can be overridden, or have higher priority, by making use of the `@Qualifier` annotation. So in this example here, qualifier has a higher priority. So even though there's a primary coach, `TrackCoach`, this example will actually make use of `CricketCoach`. 


```Java DemoController.java
package com.opf.springboot.demo.rest;

import com.opf.springboot.demo.common.Coach;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;

@RestController
public class DemoController {
    // the field for the dependency
    private Coach myCoach;

    // the constructor for the dependency
    @Autowired
    public DemoController(@Qualifier("cricketCoach") Coach theCoach) {
        myCoach = theCoach;
    }

    // the mapping for "/dailyworkout"
    @GetMapping("/dailyworkout")
    public String getDailyWorkout() {
        return myCoach.getDailyWorkout();
    }
}

```

Which one should we use, `@Primary` or `@Qualifier`? Well, `@Primary` leads it up to the implementation classes. You could have issues of multiple primary classes, leading to an error. `@Qualifier` allows you to be very specific on which bean you want. And so in general, we recommend using `@Qualifier`, and the reasoning is that it's more specific, and it also has a higher priority, compared to `@Primary` annotation. This all looks pretty good.



# Laboratory


## Step 1: Dependency

And here are the Coach and CricketCoach and other bean IDs out there that we could use such as `baseballCoach`, `trackCoach`, or `tennisCoach`.


```java Coach
...

public interface Coach {

    String getDailyWorkout();
}

```


```java CricketCoach
...

@Component
public class CricketCoach implements Coach{

    @Override
    public String getDailyWorkout() {

        return "Practice fast bowling for 15 minutes.";
    }
}

```


```Java BaseballCoach.java
package com.opf.springboot.demo.common;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
@Primary
public class BaseballCoach implements Coach {

    @Override
    public String getDailyWorkout() {
        
        return "Spend 30 minutes in batting practice";
    }
}

```

```Java TennisCoach.java
package com.opf.springboot.demo.common;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class TennisCoach implements Coach {

    @Override
    public String getDailyWorkout() {

        return "Practice your backhand volley";
    }
}

```

```Java TrackCoach.java
package com.opf.springboot.demo.common;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class TrackCoach implements Coach {

    @Override
    public String getDailyWorkout() {

        return "Practice fast bowling for 15 minutes";
    }
}

```


## Step 2: The Controller

We will make use of the `@Qualifier` annotation here to call CricketCoach over the `@Primary` annotated BaseballCoach.


```Java DemoController.java
package com.opf.springboot.demo.rest;

import com.opf.springboot.demo.common.Coach;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;

@RestController
public class DemoController {
    // the field for the dependency
    private Coach myCoach;

    // the constructor for the dependency
    @Autowired
    public DemoController(@Qualifier("cricketCoach") Coach theCoach) {
        myCoach = theCoach;
    }

    // the mapping for "/dailyworkout"
    @GetMapping("/dailyworkout")
    public String getDailyWorkout() {

        return myCoach.getDailyWorkout();
    }
}

```
