# Overview

For **auto wiring**, we're injecting a `Coach` implementation. So, Spring will scan for components, check to see if anyone implements a given `Coach` interface. If so, let's inject them. But if we have multiple implementations, what algorithm will Spring use to determine which coach that it should implement? 

Say we: have coach, cricket coach, baseball coach, track coach, tennis coach, et cetera. And then, we have the actual source code for these implementations. So, we have: `CricketCoach`, `BaseballCoach`, `TrackCoach` and `TennisCoach`. All implement the `Coach` interface. 

So, when we ask for a `Coach` implementation, which one will Spring pick? Well, we have a little problem. So, this is the error message that you'll actually encounter when you run your application. Spring will say there's a parameter 0 of the constructor and the controller required a single bean, but four were found. Okay so, I need a coach, but there's too many of them out here. And at this point, Spring will not start up. The application will not start because there's too much ambiguity. Spring can't figure out which one you want. 

So, one solution here is to be specific and that's by making use of the `@Qualifier` annotation. And so, here's our coding here for our `DemoController`.


## Step 1: The Controller

We will make use of the `@Qualifier` annotation here.


```Java DemoController.java
package com.opf.springboot.demo.rest;

import com.opf.springboot.demo.common.Coach;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;

@RestController
public class DemoController {
    // the field for the dependency
    private Coach myCoach;

    // the constructor for the dependency
    @Autowired
    public DemoController(@Qualifier("cricketCoach") Coach theCoach) {
        myCoach = theCoach;
    }

    // the mapping for "/dailyworkout"
    @GetMapping("/dailyworkout")
    public String getDailyWorkout() {

        return myCoach.getDailyWorkout();
    }
}

```

And everything looks the same except for this one new entry here for `@Qualifier`. So, here we give qualifier and then we specify the **bean ID** of `cricketCoach`. The bean ID has the same name as the class except for the first character as lowercase. All right. So, that's how we come up with `cricketCoach` here, starting with lower case. And this will actually resolve the issue because now we're being very specific.

Now that's for constructor injection. For setter injection, you can do a similar thing. You can also use the `@Qualifier` annotation. And then, here's our code examples:


```Java DemoController.java
package com.opf.springboot.demo.rest;

import com.opf.springboot.demo.common.Coach;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;

@RestController
public class DemoController {
    // the field for the dependency
    private Coach myCoach;

    // the constructor for the dependency
    // the constructor for the dependency
    @Autowired
    public void setCoach(@Qualifier("cricketCoach") Coach theCoach) {
        myCoach = theCoach;
    }

    // the mapping for "/dailyworkout"
    @GetMapping("/dailyworkout")
    public String getDailyWorkout() {
        return myCoach.getDailyWorkout();
    }
}

```

Our normal setter method `setCoach` and then we specify `@Qualifier` annotation and then give `cricketCoach`. Again, the bean ID is the same name as the class except for the first character is lowercase.


## Step 2: The Dependency

And here are the Coach and CricketCoach and other bean IDs out there that we could use such as `baseballCoach`, `trackCoach`, or `tennisCoach`.


```java Coach
...

public interface Coach {

    String getDailyWorkout();
}

```


```java CricketCoach
...

@Component
public class CricketCoach implements Coach{

    @Override
    public String getDailyWorkout() {

        return "Practice fast bowling for 15 minutes.";
    }
}

```


```Java BaseballCoach.java
package com.opf.springboot.demo.common;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class BaseballCoach implements Coach {

    @Override
    public String getDailyWorkout() {
        
        return "Spend 30 minutes in batting practice";
    }
}

```

```Java TennisCoach.java
package com.opf.springboot.demo.common;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class TennisCoach implements Coach {

    @Override
    public String getDailyWorkout() {

        return "Practice your backhand volley";
    }
}

```

```Java TrackCoach.java
package com.opf.springboot.demo.common;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class TrackCoach implements Coach {

    @Override
    public String getDailyWorkout() {

        return "Practice fast bowling for 15 minutes";
    }
}

```

So remember the `@Component` annotation marks the class as a spring bean so that Spring could find it.
