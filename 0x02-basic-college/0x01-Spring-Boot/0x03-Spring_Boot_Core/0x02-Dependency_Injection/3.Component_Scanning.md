# Component Scanning

This lesson will cover **Component Scanning** with Spring. Spring will scan your Java classes for special annotations such as `@Component`, and it'll automatically register the beans in the Spring container. 

Let's look at some Java source code here. So in our project, we currently have this `DemoApplication`. That's our main Spring Boot application class that was created by the Spring Initializer. We also have our RestController that we created in an earlier lesson, called `DemoController`. 

## `@SpringBootApplication`

Now, in that Spring main application, the one that was created by the Spring Initializer, note here that it does an import on `@SpringBootApplication`. 

```Java DemoApplication.java
package com.opf.springboot.demo;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
public class DemoApplication {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);
	}

}
```

So this enables **auto configuration**, **component scanning**, and **additional configuration** with Spring Boot. 

And really behind the scenes, the `@SpringBootApplication` annotation is composed of the following annotations,

  + `@EnableAutoConfiguration` enables Spring Boot's **auto configuration** support 

  + `@ComponentScan` enables **component scanning** of the current package and also recursively scans the sub-packages, and the 

  + `@Configuration` annotation is able to **register extra beans** with the `@Bean` annotation or import other configuration classes. 

So we know the information here about the **Spring Boot application** annotation. The **Spring application** allows us to bootstrap our Spring Boot application, and then we give a reference here to the actual name of our class, in this case, `DemoApplication`. Then by calling, `SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);`. Behind the scenes this will create the Application Context, register all the beans, and also start the embedded server such as Tomcat, et cetera, by default. 

## Component Scanning

By default, Spring Boot starts component scanning from the package that is your main Spring Boot application. And also it scans the sub-packages recursively. This implicitly defines a base search package that you can make use of. So it allows you to leverage default component scanning without having to explicitly reference the base package name. So basically it starts scanning at the main Spring Boot application class level and then all sub-packages underneath that. 

### **Different Location**

Now, a common pitfall when you're making use of Spring Boot, you may say, Hey, I'm going to use different packages and move things around and change things up or whatever. However, Spring Boot will only component-scan the package of the main Spring Boot application class and sub-packages. So this is very important. So, the default scanning works fine if everything is under `com.opf.springcoredemo`, the main package.

The question is, what about my other packages in the root folder where the main package is? Like I want to use some different names or whatever like `com.opf.util`, or `org.acme.cart`, or `edu.cmu.srs`. How will this work out, or how can I configure this accordingly?

Well, what you can do is, in your `@SpringBootApplication` annotation, you can tell it to scan base packages. So, here I'm going to explicitly list the base packages to scan. And you simply give a comma-delimited list of those packages that you want Spring Boot to scan.

```Java DemoApplication.java
package com.opf.springboot.demo;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication(
	scanBasePackages = {
		"com.opf.springcoredemo",
		"com.opf.util",
		"org.acme.cart",
		"edu.cmu.srs"
	})
public class DemoApplication {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);
	}

}
```

All right, so this is all really good stuff. We're going to write the code. We will see how to make use of default scanning, and also we will see how to manually list the actual package scanning.

## Step 1: The Controller

Create a new package, `com.opf.util` outside the main application package, `com.opf.springcoredemo`, so that we may have some issues with some of our default **component scanning**. Move `Coach` and `CricketCoach` to this new `util` package.

So, Spring will scan everything in this package and any sub-packages, but by default Spring will not component scan this new package. When we run the main application.

```Java DemoApplication.java
package com.opf.springboot.demo;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
public class DemoApplication {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);
	}

}
```

The controller code is used to map the endpoint `/dailyworkout`.

```java DemoController
package com.opfolaranmi.demo_web.controller;

import com.opfolaranmi.demo_web.sport.Coach;
import com.opfolaranmi.demo_web.sport.CricketCoach;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class DemoController {

    Coach coach;
    @Autowired
    public DemoController(Coach theCoach) {
        coach = theCoach;
    }

    @GetMapping("/dailyworkout")
    public String getTheDailyWorkoutForCoach() {
        return coach.getDailyWorkout();
    }
}
```

The application fails when run. To solve this, I'll explicitly list the base packages to scan in a comma-delimited list. By default of the component scan, only `com.opf.springcoredemo` will be scanned, but we have `util`, so we have to list both of those here. 

```Java DemoApplication.java
package com.opf.springboot.demo;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication(
		scanBasePackages = {
				"com.opf.springboot.demo",
				"com.opf.util"
		})
public class DemoApplication {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);
	}
}
```

Let's go ahead and run this and test it out, and yes, the issue's resolved. So, the application actually starts up successfully. We don't have the problem that we had before. And then, we can test this in our browser by hitting this endpoint and just doing a reload on it and we get the data back as desired, so it's able to find everything.



# Laboratory


## Step 1: Define the Dependency Interface and Class


```Java util/Coach.java
package com.opfolaranmi.demo_web.sport;

public interface Coach {

    String getDailyWorkout();
}

```


```Java util/CricketCoach.java
package com.opfolaranmi.demo_web.sport;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class CricketCoach implements Coach{

    @Override
    public String getDailyWorkout() {

        return "Practice fast bowling for 15 minutes.";
    }
}

```


## Step 2: Create our REST Controller


```java DemoController
package com.opfolaranmi.demo_web.controller;

import com.opfolaranmi.demo_web.sport.Coach;
import com.opfolaranmi.demo_web.sport.CricketCoach;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class DemoController {

    Coach coach;
    @Autowired
    public DemoController(Coach theCoach) {

        coach = theCoach;
    }

    @GetMapping("/dailyworkout")
    public String getTheDailyWorkoutForCoach() {

        return coach.getDailyWorkout();
    }
}

```


```Java DemoApplication.java
package com.opf.springboot.demo;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication(
		scanBasePackages = {
				"com.opf.springboot.demo",
				"com.opf.util"
		})
public class DemoApplication {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);
	}
}

```
