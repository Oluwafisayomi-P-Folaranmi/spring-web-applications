# Setter Injection

The two recommended injection types are: **constructor**, and **setter** injection. **Setter injection** is when we inject dependencies by calling setter methods on your class. Now let's take a look at an **autowiring** example. Here:

  + We want to inject a `Coach` implementation

  + Spring is going to scan for `@Components`, and it'll basically say, "Hey is there anyone that implements the `Coach` interface?" If so, let's inject them, for example, the `CricketCoach`. 


## Step 1: The Controller

So the first thing we'll do is we'll create the setter methods in our class for injections, and then we'll configure the dependency injection using the `@Autowired` annotation. Here we have our `DemoController`:


```Java DemoController.java
...

@RestController
public class DemoController {

    public Coach setCoach;

    @Autowired
    public void mySetter(Coach theCoach) {
        coach = theCoach;
    }

    @GetMapping("/dailyworkout")
    public String getTheDailyWorkoutForCoach() {

        return coach.getDailyWorkout();
    }
}

```

So in our `setCoach` method, we make use of the `@Autowired` annotation. The Spring Framework will perform operations behind the scenes for you. 

Now let's take a look at how Spring will process your application. We have our `Coach` interface, our `CricketCoach` implementation, and our `DemoController` and we want to inject the dependency into our `DemoController`. 

Behind the scenes: 

  + Spring will create an instance of the `CricketCoach`,

    ```
    CricketCoach theCoach = new CricketCoach();

    ```

  + It'll create an instance of the `DemoController`, 

    ```
    DemoController demoController = new DemoController();

    ```

  + and then it'll do, 

    ```
    demoController.setCoach(theCoach);

    ```

Now, we could also inject our dependencies by calling a setter with any method name to our class. We can give it any method name, simply give the `@Autowired` annotation.

## Step 1: The Controller


```java DemoController
package com.opfolaranmi.demo_web.controller;

import com.opfolaranmi.demo_web.sport.Coach;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class DemoController {

    public Coach coach;

    @Autowired
    public void mySetter(Coach theCoach) {
        coach = theCoach;
    }

    @GetMapping("/dailyworkout")
    public String getTheDailyWorkoutForCoach() {

        return coach.getDailyWorkout();
    }
}

```


## Step 2: The Dependency

Below are the interface and classes for the `Coach` and the `CricketCoach` respectively.


```Java Coach.java
...

public interface Coach {
  
  public String getDailyWorkout();
}

```


```Java CricketCoach.java
...

@Component
public class CricketCoach implements Coach {
  
  public String getDailyWorkout() {
    
    return "Practice fast bowling for 15 minutes";
  }
}

```
