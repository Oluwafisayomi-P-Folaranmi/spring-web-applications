# Field Injection

As we've discussed earlier, there are different Spring injection types, and so there are the types that are recommended by the **spring.io** development team: 

  + Constructor injection for required dependencies 
  + Setter injection for optional dependencies.

Now, here's an injection type that's not recommended by the `spring.io` development team, **field injection**. And field injection is no longer cool. In the early days, field injection was very popular on Spring projects but in recent years it has fallen out of favour. And why is that? Because in general, it makes the code harder to unit test. As a result, the **spring.io** team does not recommend field injection, however, you'll still see it being used on legacy projects, and also you'll see it being used in a lot of old blog posts on the internet, but now with modern times here, removing the useless field injection, and instead making use of construction or setter injection, but we will still see a quick example here of using **field injection** just in case you encounter it on some of your legacy projects. 


## Step 1: The Controller

Field injection is the idea of injecting in dependencies by setting the values on your class directly, even on private fields, and this is accomplished by using **Java Reflection**. 

So, you simply configure the dependency injection using the `@Autowired` annotation, and so here's a code example on our `DemoController`. 


```Java DemoController.java
package com.opf.springboot.demo.rest;

import com.opf.springboot.demo.common.Coach;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;

@RestController
public class DemoController {
    // the field for the dependency
    @Autowired
    private Coach myCoach;

    // no need for constructors or setters
  
    // the mapping for "/daily workout"
    @GetMapping("/dailyworkout")
    public String getDailyWorkout() {
        return myCoach.getDailyWorkout();
    }
}

```

Notice here we have this field `private Coach = myCoach`, and we give the `@Autowired` annotation, and behind the scenes, Spring will inject a given `Coach` implementation, and it'll do it behind the scenes even on a private field.



# Laboratory


## Step 1: The Controller


```java DemoController
package com.opfolaranmi.demo_web.controller;

import com.opfolaranmi.demo_web.sport.Coach;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class DemoController {

    @Autowired
    public Coach coach;

    @GetMapping("/dailyworkout")
    public String getTheDailyWorkoutForCoach() {

        return coach.getDailyWorkout();
    }
}

```


## Step 2: The Dependency

Below are the interface and classes for the `Coach` and the `CricketCoach` respectively.


```Java Coach.java
...

public interface Coach {
  
  public String getDailyWorkout();
}

```


```Java CricketCoach.java
...

@Component
public class CricketCoach implements Coach {
  
  public String getDailyWorkout() {
    
    return "Practice fast bowling for 15 minutes";
  }
}

```
