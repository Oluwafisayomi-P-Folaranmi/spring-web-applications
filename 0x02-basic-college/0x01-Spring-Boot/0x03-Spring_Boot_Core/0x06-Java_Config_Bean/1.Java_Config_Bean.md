# Java Configured Bean 

We can also configure beans with Java code. We'll introduce a new coach. So we'll have this `SwimCoach` that implements the `Coach` interface. We will not use the `@Component` annotation, but use Java code. 

## Step 1: The Dependency

```java Coach
package com.opfolaranmi.demo_web.sport;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

public interface Coach {

    String getDailyWorkout();
}

```


```java TrackCoach
package com.opfolaranmi.demo_web.sport;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
@Scope(ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_PROTOTYPE)
public class TrackCoach implements Coach {

    public TrackCoach() {

        System.out.println("In constructor: " + getClass().getSimpleName());
    }

    @Override
    public String getDailyWorkout() {

        return "4.......... Practice fast bowling for 15 minutes";
    }
}

```


```java TennisCoach
package com.opfolaranmi.demo_web.sport;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class TennisCoach implements Coach {

    public TennisCoach() {

        System.out.println("In constructor: " + getClass().getSimpleName());
    }

    @Override
    public String getDailyWorkout() {

        return "3.......  Practice your backhand volley";
    }
}

```


```java BaseballCoach
package com.opfolaranmi.demo_web.sport;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class BaseballCoach implements Coach {

    public BaseballCoach() {

        System.out.println("In constructor: " + getClass().getSimpleName());
    }

    @Override
    public String getDailyWorkout() {

        return "1.......... Spend 30 minutes ----------------- in batting practice";
    }
}

```


```java CricketCoach
package com.opfolaranmi.demo_web.sport;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class CricketCoach implements Coach{

    public CricketCoach() {

        System.out.println("In constructor: " + getClass().getSimpleName());
    }

    @Override
    public String getDailyWorkout() {

        return "2........ Practice fast bowling for 15 minutes.";
    }
}

```

Here is the new coach, SwimCoach


```java SwimCoach
package com.opfolaranmi.demo_web.sport;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.config.ConfigurableBeanFactory;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Scope;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
@Scope(ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_PROTOTYPE)
public class SwimCoach implements Coach{

    public SwimCoach() {

        System.out.println("In constructor: " +getClass().getSimpleName());
    }

    @Override
    public String getDailyWorkout() {

        return "I can swim through Christ that strengthens me!";
    }
}

```


### Java Configuration Using the `@Configuration` annotation. 

And then, we'll define a bean method to configure the bean.

```Java SportConfig.java 
@Configuration 
public class SportConfig {

}

```

So we'll have this public class, `SportConfig`. And then we have this annotation for configuring Spring using our custom approach. 

We'll define the `@Bean` method to configure the bean. So in this configuration class, we'll have this new annotation here, `@Bean`. So we'll manually construct the object and return it to the given caller. Now the bean ID actually defaults to the method name. So this bean will have a bean ID of swim coach.


```Java SportConfig.java 
@Configuration 
public class SportConfig {

	@Bean("aquatic")
	public Coach swimCoach() {
		return new swimCoach();
	}

}

```


### Java Configuration Bean Use-Case

Now here's the use case for the `@Bean` annotation. You may wonder why not use the `new` keyword? Why not just use the `@Component` annotation? We could do that in this example since we actually have access to the code. But what if it's a third-party class? The main use case for the `@Bean` annotation is to make an existing third-party class available to the Spring framework. In these scenarios here, you may not have access to the source code of the third-party class. You simply may have a JAR file, you want to pull that in, and then leverage on it as a Spring bean.


### application.properties

To compensate for global initialisation, we use the application.properties file. Without the `@Lazy` annotation on the classes, they will be constructor at runtime even if they are not needed. We can run the program from here before we provide configuration for global lazy initialisation.


```application.properties
spring.application.name=demo-web

...

## Global Lazy Initialisation
spring.main.lazy-initialization=true

```


## Step 2: The Controller

And in step two, we'll inject the bean into our controller. Here's our demo controller code. 


```Java DemoController.java
...

@RestController
public class DemoController {

    private Coach myCoach;

    private Coach anotherCoach;
    @Autowired
    public DemoController(@Qualifier("aquatic") Coach theCoach,
                          @Qualifier("aquatic") Coach theAnotherCoach) {

        myCoach = theCoach;
        anotherCoach = theAnotherCoach;
    }

    @GetMapping("/dailyworkout")
    public String getTheDailyWorkoutForCoach() {

        return myCoach.getDailyWorkout();
    }

    @GetMapping("/check")
    public String checkIfBeansAreEqual() {

        return "The beans are the same: " + (myCoach == anotherCoach);
    }
}

```

And then notice here for the qualifier, we make use of the bean id. Notice that the objects are the same.
