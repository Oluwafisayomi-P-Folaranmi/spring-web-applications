# Inversion of Control

***Inversion of Control is the approach of outsourcing the construction and management of objects***. So instead of us manually creating the objects ourselves, we'll outsource this to another entity.

In the context of Inversion of Control (IoC) in Java Spring Boot, **outsourcing refers to the delegation of control over the creation and management of objects to the Spring framework**. Instead of explicitly creating and managing objects within your application code, you delegate this responsibility to the Spring framework, which performs object creation, wiring, and lifecycle management based on configuration metadata (such as XML files, annotations, or Java configuration classes). This approach allows for more modular, flexible, and testable code, as it promotes loose coupling and separation of concerns. It also enables easier integration with third-party libraries and frameworks, as well as better support for dependency injection and aspect-oriented programming.

Now let's look at a coding scenario. So here's our application and we have a `CricketCoach` we'd like to call a method on the `CricketCoach`, say, give me a daily workout, `getDailyWorkout` and then it'll give us that response.

Now, this application should be configurable such that we could easily change the coach for another sport, such as baseball, hockey, tennis, gymnastics, et cetera. We can easily ask a coach for a workout and they'll give us a given response. 

Now, let's look at the ideal solution. So we have our application. We can talk to an **object factory** and say, hey, give me a `Coach` object. 

<img alt="image" src="1-img-002.png" width="100%" height="50%"/>

This object factory, based on a configuration, it'll create a coach for us and give us a reference to it. So it could create an object out of cricket coach, `CricketCoach`; a hockey coach, `HockeyCoach`; or a baseball coach, `BaseballCoach`. This is all based on a configuration. And so this is where the **Spring container** comes into place. 

So the Spring container basically works as an **object factory** in the Spring framework. So we'll tell Spring, hey, give me a given coach object in the background. Spring will determine which coach object that you need based on a configuration, and then give you a reference to that given coach object. 

Now, a bit more here as for the Spring container working as an object factory. So this Spring container has two primary functions: 

  + Create and manage the objects, using Inversion of Control, and 
  + Injecting the object dependencies, that's making use of Dependency Injection. 

Now, how can we configure the Spring container? Well, three different approaches here:

  + We can make use of XML configuration 
  + Java annotations 
  + Configuring using Java source code. 

Now, XML configuration is considered legacy so we won't cover it in this course. However, we will focus on the modern solutions here, such as **Java annotations** and **Java source code**. We have plenty examples in this section as far as making this type of configuration set up.
