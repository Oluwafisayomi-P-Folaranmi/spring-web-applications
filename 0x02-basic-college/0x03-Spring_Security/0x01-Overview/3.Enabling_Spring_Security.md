# Enabling Spring Security

Edit pom.xml and add `spring-boot-starter-security`

```xml pom.xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

This will automagically secure all endpoints for your application. Now when you access your application, Spring Security will prompt for login.

## Spring Security configuration

You can override default user name and generated password

```application.properties
spring.security.user.name=fola
spring.security.user.password=fola123
```

## Security Approaches

This appears to be a list of **different ways to implement authentication and authorization** in an application. Let's break them down:

1. **In-memory** – User credentials and roles are stored directly in memory (RAM) rather than in a database.  
   - Suitable for testing or small applications.  

2. **JDBC** – Authentication and authorization data are stored in a **relational database (RDBMS)** and accessed using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity).  
   - Common for enterprise applications.  
   - Uses tables like `users`, `roles`, and `authorities`.  

3. **LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)** – Authentication and authorization data are managed in a **centralized directory service** like Active Directory (AD).  
   - Suitable for large organizations managing users across multiple systems.  

4. **Custom / Pluggable** – Developers can define their own authentication and authorization logic.  
   - Useful when integrating with external APIs, OAuth providers, or non-standard authentication systems.  

5. **Others…** – Covers additional authentication methods such as:

   - **OAuth 2.0 & OpenID Connect (OIDC):** Used for third-party authentication (Google, Facebook, Okta, etc.).  
   - **JWT (JSON Web Token):** Token-based authentication for stateless microservices.  
   - **SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language):** Enterprise-level Single Sign-On (SSO).  
   - **API Key Authentication:** Using API tokens for machine-to-machine authentication.  

We will cover password storage in DB as plain-text, and encrypted.
