# Spring Security Model

Spring Security is a comprehensive framework that provides authentication, authorization, and other security-related functionalities for Java applications, particularly those built with Spring Boot and Spring Framework. It defines a structured approach to securing applications by offering various security mechanisms, including:  

1. **Authentication** – Verifying user identities using credentials such as usernames, passwords, OAuth2 tokens, or other authentication providers (LDAP, JWT, etc.).  

2. **Authorization** – Controlling user access to different parts of an application based on roles, permissions, and security policies.  

3. **Session Management** – Handling user sessions securely, including features like session timeout, concurrent session control, and automatic session invalidation on logout.  

4. **CSRF Protection** – Preventing Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks by ensuring that state-changing requests are authenticated.  

5. **CORS Support** – Managing Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies to regulate access from different domains.  

6. **Security Filters** – A powerful filter chain that intercepts and secures HTTP requests at various stages, enabling fine-grained control over authentication and authorization processes.  

7. **OAuth2 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) Support** – Integrating modern authentication mechanisms like OAuth2 and OIDC for secure authentication with identity providers such as Google, Okta, and Keycloak.  

8. **Method-Level Security** – Applying security rules at the method level using annotations like `@PreAuthorize`, `@PostAuthorize`, and `@Secured`.  

9. **Password Encoding & Security** – Enforcing strong password encoding using bcrypt and other hashing algorithms to protect stored credentials.  

10. **Integration with Other Spring Modules** – Seamlessly working with Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Spring Data, and other modules to create a secure, scalable application.

## Security Approaches

Securing an application can be achieved through two main approaches: **declarative security** and **programmatic security**. These approaches define how security policies, authentication, and authorization are implemented within an application.

### **1. Declarative Security**  

***Declarative security involves configuring security rules externally, typically through configuration files, annotations, or frameworks like Spring Security***. This method keeps security concerns separate from business logic, making the application more maintainable and scalable.

#### **Examples of Declarative Security:**

  - XML-based Security (Older Approach)
  - Annotation-based Security (Modern Approach)
  - Spring Security Configuration (Java-based)
  - Access Control Lists (ACLs) and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

#### **Advantages of Declarative Security:**

- Separation of concerns: Security logic is defined separately from business logic.
- Easier maintenance: Changes to security rules can be made without modifying code.
- Less error-prone: Standard security configurations reduce the risk of security flaws.

### **2. Programmatic Security**

***Programmatic security is implemented directly in the application code***, where security decisions are made dynamically based on conditions or logic within the application.

#### **Examples of Programmatic Security:**

- Checking User Roles in Code
- Manually Authenticating Users
- Custom Security Logic

#### **Advantages of Programmatic Security:**

- Greater flexibility: Allows dynamic, fine-grained control over security based on runtime conditions.
- Custom logic: Security rules can be based on business-specific requirements.
- Context-awareness: Security decisions can consider real-time data (e.g., user behavior, transaction limits).

## Spring Security with Servlet Filter

Servlet filters are Java components that intercept and process HTTP requests and responses before they reach a servlet or after a servlet has processed them. They play a crucial role in security by enforcing access controls, authentication, and request modifications.  

### **Servlet Filters are used to pre-process / post-process web requests**

Servlet filters allow developers to manipulate HTTP requests **before** they reach the application’s business logic (pre-processing) and modify HTTP responses **after** the request is handled (post-processing).  

**Examples:**

- **Pre-processing:** Checking authentication tokens, validating user sessions, logging requests.  
- **Post-processing:** Modifying response headers, applying security headers, logging responses.  

### **Servlet Filters can route web requests based on security logic**

Filters can act as **gatekeepers** by redirecting or blocking requests based on security conditions. They determine whether a request should be allowed, denied, or forwarded to another endpoint.  

**Use Cases:**

- Redirecting unauthenticated users to a login page.  
- Blocking requests from suspicious IPs.  
- Enforcing HTTPS redirection for security.  

### **Spring provides a bulk of security functionality with servlet filters** 

Spring Security heavily relies on a chain of **servlet filters** to handle authentication and authorization. These filters automatically secure an application by applying security mechanisms at different stages of request processing.  

**Key Filters in Spring Security:**

- **`UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter`** – Handles login authentication.  
- **`BasicAuthenticationFilter`** – Supports HTTP Basic Authentication.  
- **`OAuth2LoginAuthenticationFilter`** – Manages OAuth2 authentication.  
- **`CsrfFilter`** – Protects against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).  
- **`SecurityContextPersistenceFilter`** – Maintains user security context across requests.  

Spring Security operates as a flexible and extensible framework, allowing developers to customize security configurations to meet the specific needs of their applications while ensuring industry-standard security practices.
