# Users

Security is about **authentication** and **authorisation**.

  + ***To be authenticated, we need the user (name) and password***.
  + ***To be authorised, the user needs to have some roles to perform some privileges***.

The following table shows examples of users, their roles and privileges:

| User ID | Password | Roles                 |
|---------|---------|----------------------|
| john    | test123 | EMPLOYEE             |
| mary    | test123 | EMPLOYEE, MANAGER    |
| susan   | test123 | EMPLOYEE, MANAGER, ADMIN |

  + John has the privilege of `EMPLOYEE`, i.e., John can view resources only employees are authorised to view.
  + Mary on the higher hand has both privileges for `EMPLOYEE` and `MANAGER`. Mary is a manager, thus an employee of the company. She can view resources only managers (also an employees) are authorised to view.
  + On the highest view here, Susan has roles of `EMPLOYEE`, `MANAGER`, and `ADMIN`. Susan can view resources only managers, admin (also an employees) are authorised to view.
