# Configuration

Thus, taking our configuration away from `application.properties` file, we can do it in a Java bean annotated with `@Configuration`.

We create the Configuration class, then add users, password, and roles. Any call to an endpoint in our application will require user names and password for ***authentication***. After being authenticated, calls to other resources will check for ***authorisation*** of the logged-in user.
