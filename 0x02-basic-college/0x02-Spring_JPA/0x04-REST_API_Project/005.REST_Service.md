# REST Service

## The REST Controller

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/office")
public class EmployeeRESTController {

    ...

    // expose "/employees" and return a list of employees
    @GetMapping("/employees")
    public List<Employee> findAll() {
        return employeeServiceImpl.findAll();
    }

    // add mapping for GET "/employee/{employeeId}"
    @GetMapping("/employees/{employeeId}")
    public Employee findById(@PathVariable int employeeId) {

        Employee employee = null;

        // Try if student id is a number
        try {
            employee = employeeService.findById(employeeId);
        }
        catch (RuntimeException e) {
            throw new RuntimeException("Input parameter is not a number");
        }

        // Try this to catch `0` or negative integers
        if (employeeId == 0 || employeeId < 0 || employee == null) {
            throw new EmployeeNotFoundException("The employee is not found.");
        }

        // If there is no exception
        return new ResponseEntity<>(employee, HttpStatus.OK);
    }

    // add mapping for POST /employees - add new employee
    @PostMapping("/employees")
    public ResponseEntity<Employee> setStudent(@RequestBody Employee employee) {
        employeeService.save(employee);

        // also just in case they pass an id in JSON ... set id to 0
        // this is to force a save of new item ... instead of update
        // employee.setId(0L);
        Employee theEmployee = employeeService.save(employee);
        return new ResponseEntity<>(theEmployee, HttpStatus.OK);
    }

    // add mapping for PUT /employees - update existing employee
    @PutMapping("/employees")
    public Employee updateEmployee(@RequestBody Employee employee) {

        Employee theEmployee = employeeService.save(employee);

        return theEmployee;
    }

    // add mapping for DELETE /employees/{employeeId} - delete employee
    @DeleteMapping("/employees/{employeeId}")
    public ResponseEntity<Employee> deleteEmployee(@PathVariable Long employeeId) {

        Employee employee;

        // Try if student id is a number
        try {
            employee = employeeService.findById(employeeId);
        }
        catch (RuntimeException e) {
            throw new RuntimeException("Input parameter is not a number");
        }

        // Try this to catch `0` or negative integers
        if (employeeId == 0 || employeeId < 0 || employee == null) {
            throw new EmployeeNotFoundException("The employee is not found.");
        }

        // delete
        employeeService.delete(employeeId);

        return new ResponseEntity<>(employee, HttpStatus.OK);
    }
}
```

### POST Method

Following is a sample of a json we can pass to the `POST` method. Since it is a new employee, we're not passing the id. We want the id to be generated.

```json
{
    "firstName": "Avani",
    "lastName": "Gupta",
    "email": "avani@luv2code.com"
}
```

When sending JSON data to Spring REST Controllers, we need to set HTTP request header for the controller to process the data. The HTTP request header is `Content-type: application/json`.

So, we need to configure our rest client to send the correct HTTP request header. The process in Postman is to pick:
  
  1. **Body**
  2. **Raw**
  3. **Content-type**: JSON(application/json)

Based on this configs, Postman will automatically set the correct HTTP request header.

The request body is going to come in as JSON. So will use the `@RequestBody` annotation to bind the JSON with a given `Employee` object.

Also, just in case they pass an id as JSON, we are going to manually 

### PUT Method

The `id` of employee to update with updated info.

```json
{
    "id": 2,
    "firstName": "Avani",
    "lastName": "Gupta",
    "email": "avani@luv2code.com"
}
```

The response contains updated info.

## Test Application

Let's test the endpoints

1. GET `http://localhost:8080/office/employees`
   + ***Confirmed***: Returned the list of employess.
2. GET `http://localhost:8080/office/employee/<valid-id>`
   + ***Confirmed***: Returned the student with id of `<valid-id>`.
3. POST `http://localhost:8080/office/employees`
   + ***Confirmed***: Returned added student with id.
4. PUT `http://localhost:8080/office/employees`
   + ***Confirmed***: Returned updated student id.
5. DEL `http://localhost:8080/office/employees/<valid-id>`
   + ***Confirmed***: Returned the student with id of `<valid-id>`.
