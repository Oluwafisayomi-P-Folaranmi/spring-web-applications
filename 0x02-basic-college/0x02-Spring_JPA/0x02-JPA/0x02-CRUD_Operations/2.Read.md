# Reading Objects 

Now we'll focus on reading an object. In this example we will retrieve a student using a primary key of `1`. Here I make use of: 

## DAO Interface

Here's our student DAO interface with the new method called `findById()` that returns a student and we pass in the integer `ID`. And that's the basic coding here for this new method. 

```Java 
public interface StudentDAO {
	...

	Student findById(Integer id);
}
```

## DAO Implementation

Now, we'll move ahead to add a new method, `findById()` to the DAO implementation. 

```Java
public class StudentDAOImpl implements StudentDAO {

	private EntityManager entityManager;

	...

	@Override
	public Student findById(Integer theId) {
		return entityManager.find(Student.class, theId);
	}
}
```

We'll say `entityManager.find()` and we will give the actual entity class, `Student.class`, and the primary key, the ID. 

## Main Application

And then finally in step three, we'll update the main application to use this new DAO method. 

We'll call this method `readStudent()`. In the method, we'll start off by creating a student object, we'll save the student, we'll display the ID of that student, we'll retrieve the student based on the ID and then also display the student. 

```Java
@SpringBootApplication
public class CruddemoApplication {

	...

	@Bean
	public CommandLineRunner commandLineRunner(StudentDAO studentDAO) {
		return runner -> {
      		// createStudent(studentDAO);
      		// createMultipleStudents(studentDAO);
			readStudent(studentDAO);
		};
	}

  ...

	private void readStudent(StudentDAO studentDAO) {
 		
 		// create a student object
 		System.out.println("Creating new student object...");
 		Student tempStudent = new Student("Daffy", "Duck", "daffy@luv2code.com");

 		// save the student object
 		System.out.println("Saving the student...");
 		studentDAO.save(tempStudent);

 		// display id of the saved student
 		System.out.println("Saved student. Generated id: " + tempStudent.getId());
 		// retrieve student based on the id: primary key
 		System.out.println("\nRetrieving student with id: " + tempStudent.getId());
 		Student myStudent = studentDAO.findById(tempStudent.getId());
 		System.out.println("Found the student: " + myStudent);
 	}
}
```

We simply create a new student for "Daffy Duck"". We save the student using the code that we've created before, `studentDAO.save(tempStudent)`, and then we'll display the ID of the save student. 

I'll create a variable here, the ID of `tempStudent.getId()`, I'll display it. And then I make that call `studentDAO.findById()`, and I pass in the ID. 

We're really executing our new code here that we just created. And then we simply print out `myStudent`. 

Moving over to MySQL Workbench and then just do a query on that student table and success. So we see that Daffy Duck here is in the list of students for this given database. So this is great, I'm happy.
