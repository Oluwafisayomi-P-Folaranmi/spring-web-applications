# REST Read

## REST Controller

Let's go ahead and define another endpoint, `/college/students/{studentId}` for retrieving a single student. And here we'll keep it simple and we'll actually return it by the index of that array list. 

```Java
...

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/college")
public class CollegeController {

    ...

    @GetMapping("/student/{studentId}")
    public ResponseEntity<Student> getStudent(@PathVariable Long studentId) {
        Student student = studentDAO.findById(studentId);
        return new ResponseEntity<>(student, HttpStatus.OK);
    }
}
```

So I can access an element in the list by simply using `theStudents.get()`. 

Let's go ahead and run this on our server. And then once it's up and running, give `/api/students/0`. So it should come back as the first element in the list of students. So this is working out as desired.
