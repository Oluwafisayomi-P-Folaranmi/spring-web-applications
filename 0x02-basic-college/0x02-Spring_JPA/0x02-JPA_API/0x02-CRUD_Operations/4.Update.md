# Updating Objects 

## Update to Single Entity 

Now, to update an object, we first find the object by using `entityManager.find()`. Then we simply call a setter method on the objects to actually change their value. There, we go ahead and perform an `entityManager.merge()`. So the `merge()` here will tell the entity manager to update the entity. 

```Java
Student theStudent = entityManager.find(Student.class, 1);

// change first name to "Scooby"
theStudent.setFirstName("Scooby");
entityManager.merge(theStudent);
```

## Update to Multiple Entities

Now, the previous example was for updating a single object. You can also update multiple objects. Here, we're going to update the last name for all students. We'll make use of this `entityManager.createQuery()`. 

```Java
int numRowsUpdated = entityManager.createQuery("UPDATE Student SET lastName='Tester'").executeUpdate();
```

And then we call `executeUpdate()` to actually execute this given statement, and then it'll return the number of rows that were updated. 

## Development Process 

Here's the development process for adding this to our DAO. 

  1. Add the New Method to the DAO Interface, 
  2. Add the New Method to the DAO Implementation, 
  3. Update our Main Application.

## The DAO Interface

Let's start with step one of adding a new method to the DAO interface. And we'll add this new method here, update, that takes in a student object.

```Java
public interface StudentDAO {
	...

	Object update(Object theObject);
}
```

## The DAO Implementation 

```Java
public class StudentDAOImpl implements StudentDAO {
	...
	
	@Override
	@Transactional
	public Object update(Object theObject) {

	    Object dbStudent = entityManager.merge(theObject);
	    return dbStudent;
	}
}
```

## Main Application 

Let's update the main application. 

```Java
@SpringBootApplication
public class DemoApplication {
	...

	@Bean
	public CommandLineRunner commandLineRunner(DAO dao) {
		return runner -> {
			updateStudent(dao);
		};
	}

	void updateStudent(DAO dao) {

		// Old info of student
		/// set an id
		int theId = 2;
		/// Find the old student
		Object oldInfoStudent = dao.findById(theId);
		/// Display it
		System.out.println("The old student is: ");
		System.out.println(oldInfoStudent.toString());

		// Update student
		/// Create a new student with the id of the old student
		Student newStudent = new Student("Okoli", "Okon", "okoliokon@gmail.com", "Nigeria");
		/// Set the id of the new student to the id of the old student
		newStudent.setId(theId);
		/// merge new student to existing student
		Object updatedStudent = dao.update(newStudent);

		// New info of student
		System.out.println("The new student is: ");
		System.out.println(updatedStudent.toString());
	}
}
```
