# The DAO

## Define the DAO Interface

So this is basically a Java interface and we define a method here, `save()` which will take the parameter of a student object reference. We did all the mapping work already. 

```Java StudentDAO.java 
public interface StudentDAO {

		void save(Student theStudent);
}
```

## Define the DAO Implementation 

We define the DAO implementation. Here we have our class `StudentDAOImpl` that implements `StudentDAO`. 

```Java
@Repository
public class StudentDAOImpl implements StudentDAO {
	
	private EntityManager entityManager;
	
	@Autowired
	public StudentDAOImpl(EntityManager entityManager) {
		this.entityManager = entityManager;
	}

}
```

And Spring also provides some specialized annotations for DAOs. So Spring has this `@Repository` annotation, which is a sub-annotation of `@Component`. The `@RestController` is also a sub-annotation of `@Component`. `@Repository` is for annotating DAOs. This annotation is applied to DAO implementations, and Spring, using component scanning, will automatically register the DAO implementation. 

We have this field for `EntityManager` that we inject into the DAO using the constructor for the `StudentDAOImpl` class. We make the assignment accordingly within this constructor.
