# Spring MVC CRUD 


## Uses of Spring Boot and Spring MVC CRUD 
 
We want to perform CRUD operations using Spring MVC. Spring MVC is designed for building web applications following the Model-View-Controller pattern, facilitating clean separation of concerns. It supports handling HTTP requests, form validation, and integrating various view technologies. 

When Spring Boot and Spring MVC are combined, they offer a powerful solution for creating CRUD applications, with Spring Boot managing the infrastructure and configuration, and Spring MVC handling web requests and business logic.
