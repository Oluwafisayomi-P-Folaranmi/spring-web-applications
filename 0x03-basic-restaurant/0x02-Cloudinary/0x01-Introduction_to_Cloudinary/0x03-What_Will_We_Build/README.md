## **What Will We Build?**

In this tutorial, we will integrate Cloudinary into a Spring Boot application to handle media files efficiently. Our implementation will include:

#### **Core Features:**

+ âœ… **Uploading images** to Cloudinary from a Spring Boot API.
+ âœ… **Retrieving and displaying images** using Cloudinary URLs.
+ âœ… **Applying transformations** such as resizing, cropping, and watermarking.
+ âœ… **Deleting images** securely from Cloudinary.
+ âœ… **Handling errors and exceptions gracefully** to ensure a smooth user experience.

#### **Real-World Use Cases:**

+ ðŸ”¹ **E-commerce platforms** â€“ Manage product images dynamically.
+ ðŸ”¹ **Social media applications** â€“ Allow users to upload profile pictures.
+ ðŸ”¹ **Blogging platforms** â€“ Optimize images for SEO and performance.
+ ðŸ”¹ **Video streaming services** â€“ Deliver optimized videos with adaptive streaming.

By the end of this tutorial, you will have a fully functional **Spring Boot REST API** that interacts seamlessly with Cloudinary to manage images effectively.
